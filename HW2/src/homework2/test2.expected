# Test aliasing, one node, two nodes

created graph graph1
created node n1 with cost 5
created node n2 with cost 5
created node n3 with cost 5

added node n1 to graph1
graph1 contains: n1
added node n2 to graph1
graph1 contains: n1 n2
added node n3 to graph1
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3

added edge from n1 to n1 in graph1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1
