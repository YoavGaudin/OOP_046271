# test one child, two childs

created graph graph1
created node n1 with cost 5
created node n2 with cost 5
created node n3 with cost 5

added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

added edge from n1 to n2 in graph1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2
# test adding the same edge twice has no effect
added edge from n1 to n2 in graph1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2

added edge from n1 to n3 in graph1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2 n3
